            p.summary One of my favorite responsibilities is to train coworkers on new technologies, Asp.Net MVC, jQuery and CSS (specifically for developers). I often serve as project lead which includes making platform and architectural decisions for new projects, risk analysis and suggestions for new features, developing quotes, time schedules and delivery dates, creating reusable components and examples for other projects, and coding in all tiers of a n-tier site.
