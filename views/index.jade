      I am a software application developer in Birmingham Alabama. I specialize in front-end work (javascript, jQuery, html5 and css) 
      but have built many systems from the database up and have even created a custom web api to respond to low level devices. Most 
      often, I lead each project I work on. This includes making platform and architectural decisions for new projects, risk analysis 
      and suggestions for new features, developing quotes, time schedules, and delivery dates, creating reusable components and 
      examples for other projects, and coding in all tiers of a n-tier site. I have a passion for learning everything new in 
      technology and love to teach what I've learned to others.
